# Image Classification Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks

## Problem Statement

### Domain: 
Botanical Research

### Context:
A university is conducting research to understand the characteristics of plants and seedlings at various stages of growth. They have already curated a set of sample images. The university requires a solution to automate the classification of plant species based on the given images.

### Objective:
The objective is to design and implement an image classifier that can accurately determine the species of a plant from a photograph.

### Dataset:
The dataset consists of images from 12 different plant species. The data can be found at [Kaggle - Plant Seedlings Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data).

## Project Tasks and Steps:

### 1. Data Import and Analysis
   - Import the dataset and analyze the dimensions and characteristics of the data.
   - Visualize the data to gain insights and a better understanding of the input images.

### 2. Model Design and Training
   - Design, train, and tune several machine learning models, including:
     - Supervised learning classifiers
     - Neural networks (NN)
     - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   - Experiment with different algorithms and fine-tune hyperparameters for each model to achieve the best performance.

### 3. Model Comparison and Evaluation
   - Compare the performance of the trained models based on relevant metrics.
   - Provide detailed observations on why and how the best-performing algorithm outperforms the others in terms of accuracy, precision, or other relevant metrics.

### 4. Model Deployment
   - Save (pickle) the best-performing model for future use.

### 5. Prediction
   - Use the trained image classifier model to predict the class of a test image from the "Prediction" folder.
   - Display the test image and its predicted class.
